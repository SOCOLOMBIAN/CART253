## Description 

This project took the inspiration from the inital frog game desing of catching flies, i wanted to take further the implementation of the frog and change the apperance of the overall game but staying with the principal characters as the frog and flies. The game aim to implement 2 scenarios that will lead the frog to a conclusion (good or bad). In the first part the frog is able to catch one type of fly, the tongue can move around all the scenario and it has to reach a >< of 10 flies to be able to go troughout the second level. In the second level, the player is able to recognize a appereance change on the frog, from this part i was inspired to make the frog look as the most dangerous frog in the world, wich is from Colombia, the color of the frog is yellow. At this moment, because the frog is more dangerous and powerful, the a new kind of fly appear, with different mouvement and the other flies move faster. But the frog is asked to choose between two options, be gentle and leave the frog live or still eating. During the 2 level the user with a simple keypressed will choose the destiny of the frog.
