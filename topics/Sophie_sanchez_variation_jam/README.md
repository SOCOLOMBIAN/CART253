## Description 

This projects was inspired by the studies of the brain, i tried to approach the game interactivity when lisenting to sounds and seeing colors, I wanted to create something where the user can overcome challenges that became more difficult when the step to a new level, the user will have the opportunity to interact with 2 games, the first game is about eating the color balls, using only the mouse and the rapidity when clicking, since the user will have a time limit to go trought the next level, if the user is not able to pass to the second level, is possible to try again. In the level 2 is more difficult since the user will have a more moving challenge since it have to reach a ceratin amount of points, and growth to win the game, the player who is going to be box, changes color when interacting with the color, and can move around all the canvas. At the end, you will win an experience and experiment how fast you can be, and what effect the sound and color can have on yuor brain. This experience can give a moment of fun and challenge and interaction for the user.
